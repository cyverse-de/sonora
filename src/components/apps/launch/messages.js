So generally it is advisable to leave the resource requests set to the defaults that the tool or app integrator has set.`;

This application runs on XSEDE, the U.S. National Supercomputing Network.
Analyses run on this system enter a queue that includes many non-CyVerse users.
Wait times for your analyses (jobs) to submit and run may be up to several days for large-memory applications.
Please do not resubmit your analysis.
If the status of your analysis has not changed from Submitted to Running after several days,
<support>contact support</support>.
To learn more about HPC apps, see
<hpc>Using HPC Apps in the DE</hpc>.

Apply for your own XSEDE allocation to gain access to additional resources at
<xsede>XRAS - Submit Allocation Request</xsede>.
Access to this powerful system is made available to CyVerse users at no cost through a grant from the National Science Foundation.
