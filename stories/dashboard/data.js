In this webinar, University of Arizona graduate student Sateesh Peri will demonstrate Snakemake, an open source workflow management tool. Sateesh will first identify use cases where workflow managers are helpful for automation so that you can understand Snakefile componenets, such as the rules, inputs, outputs and actions. Then he will lead us through how to write and run a Snakefile in CyVerse VICE (Visual and Interactive Compute Environment). Once you learn to properly use Snakemake (or similar workflow management tools), keeping track of and sharing your work becomes second nature, not only saving you time whenever you need to re-run all or part of an analysis but helping you reduce errors that naturally get introduced whenever a non-automated activity is done (i.e., as part of the human condition of doing computational science and not being a bot!).\n\nRegister Here\n\nAbout the Presenter: \nSateesh PeriSateesh Peri is a PhD candidate in Eric Lyon’s lab at the University of Arizona and also works at CyVerse as a graduate intern. His primary research focus is on identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs); in his spare time, Sateesh likes learning and teaching computational skills to biologists (which is why we love working with him at CyVerse!). He is an open-science evangelist and an active instructor for Data Carpentry and for CyVerse's Foundational Open Source Skills (FOSS) and Container Camp.",

The TERRA REF dataset contains remote sensing, plant trait, environmental, agronomic and genomic data. The dataset was produced to enable researchers to evaluate and develop new computational pipelines for converting sensor data into biological and agronomic understanding and solutions. David LeBauer, who led development of TERRA-REF's data and computing pipeline will describe the project along with its computing infrastructure and datasets. He will showcase the diverse suite of data generated by thermal, hyperspectral, color, laser 3D, and active photosynthetic fluorescence cameras as well as hand measurements, environmental sensors, and deep genomic sequencing.\n\nAnyone interested in plant sciences, robotics, statistics, remote sensing, data science, and how to make such data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) will benefit from learning about TERRA-REF's publicly-funded and publicly-accessible crop phenotype datasets. David will describe how the TERRA REF data was produced and how users can learn more and get started using the data and contributing new algorithms to high throughput phenomics pipelines.\n\nAbout the Presenter:\n\n\n\nDavid LeBauer is the director of Data Science for the Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Arizona. His research is focused on using science to engineer more sustainable and productive crops and agricultural systems. To support this effort, he develops open software and data to integrate data and knowledge across disciplines. Key projects include the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) framework for data synthesis and forecasting with crop and ecosystem models and the TERRA Reference phenotyping database and computing pipeline.",

                    "Research into microbial diversity and microbiomes has transformed the way we understand the environment, agriculture, and human health. Now, DNA Subway makes it easier to explore this unseen diversity in the classroom using the latest research tools in a simple interface.\n\nThe newest release of DNA Subway Purple Line is a streamlined, classroom-friendly version of the popular QIIME2 microbiome bioinformatics software. Purple Line supports large datasets (your own or provided examples) and guides educators and students through real analyses while simplifying complex tasks such as metadata validation and generation of interactive visualizations. Experienced QIIME users can export Purple Line outputs to use in custom analyses.\n\nThis one-hour webinar will covered Purple Line basics (topics below) and gets you started with Purple Line in the classroom, integration into course-based research (CUREs), and ways to generate your own data. We will also highlight future faculty DNA Barcoding and Metabarcoding for CURES Workshops.",

                    "Viruses that infect bacteria and archaea are central components in the microbial communities of both natural and human environments. If you have metagenomic assemblies or isolated genomic sequence data, and want to know how viruses may play a role in your research data, you should know about VIBRANT, a computational tool that uses sequencing data to identify, curate, annotate and estimate the quality of these viral sequences and can predict both free and integrated viruses. In this webinar, University of Wisconsin's Kristopher Kieft will give a baseline overview of the role viruses may play in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients during infections and will demonstrate how you can run VIBRANT on CyVerse, interpret the results and implement the analysis of viruses into your current genomics pipelines.\n\nWebinar materials, including interactive slides, are available here: https://cyverse.org/webinar-vibrant-automated-recovery-and-annotation-of-microbial-viruses-from-genomic-sequences\n\nCyVerse provides powerful infrastructure for computational research involving large datasets and complex analyses.

                description:
                    "This webinar introduces the TERRA-REF project that produced a large, high resolution public domain dataset to advance high throughput plant phenomics. The TERRA-REF dataset contains remote sensing, plant trait, environmental, agronomic and genomic data. The dataset was produced to enable researchers to evaluate and develop new computational pipelines for converting sensor data into biological and agronomic understanding and solutions. David LeBauer, who led development of TERRA-REF's data and computing pipeline, describes the project along with its computing infrastructure and datasets. He showcases the diverse suite of data generated by thermal, hyperspectral, color, laser 3D, and active photosynthetic fluorescence cameras as well as hand measurements, environmental sensors, and deep genomic sequencing.\n\nAnyone interested in plant sciences, robotics, statistics, remote sensing, data science, and how to make such data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) will benefit from learning about TERRA-REF's publicly-funded and publicly-accessible crop phenotype datasets. David describes how the TERRA-REF data was produced and how users can learn more and get started using the data and contributing new algorithms to high-throughput phenomics pipelines.\n\nWebinar materials, including interactive slides, are available here: https://cyverse.org/webinar-get-grounded-in-terra-ref-publicly-accessible-hi-res-sensor-data-for-crop-phenomics\n\nCyVerse provides powerful infrastructure for computational research involving large datasets and complex analyses.

                    "From where and how to get data for your analysis, to where and how to treat the outputs, workflow managers can help you achieve better scientific reproducibility and scalability. In this webinar, University of Arizona graduate student Sateesh Peri demonstrates Snakemake, an open source workflow management tool. Sateesh first identifies use cases where workflow managers are helpful for automation so that you can understand Snakefile components, such as the rules, inputs, outputs and actions. Then he leads us through how to write and run a Snakefile in CyVerse VICE (Visual and Interactive Compute Environment). Once you learn to properly use Snakemake (or similar workflow management tools), keeping track of and sharing your work becomes second nature, not only saving you time whenever you need to re-run all or part of an analysis but helping you reduce errors that naturally get introduced whenever a non-automated activity is done (i.e., you're a human, not a bot!).\n\nWebinar materials, including interactive slides, are available here: https://cyverse.org/webinar-workflow-management-using-snakemake\n\nCyVerse provides powerful infrastructure for computational research involving large datasets and complex analyses.
